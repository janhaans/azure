# Subscription

When you create a new Azure subscription you do not create a new account.  
Each Azure subscription is associated with a billing account.  
A billing account is a billing profile that contains all billing information.  
Each Azure subscription is associated with one Entra ID tenant for Identity and Access Management (IAM).  
You can set Azure policies at a subscription.  
A subscription can be member of one management group.  
Set up a budget for each subscription to prevent unexpected high costs  
The user that creates the subscription is the subscription owner and has full access to the subscription.
